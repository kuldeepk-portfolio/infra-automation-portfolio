# Infrastructure Automation Portfolio

A curated portfolio of infrastructure automation projects by **Kuldeep Kumar**.

This repository showcases real-world examples of automating system configuration, cloud infrastructure provisioning, log rotation, and CI/CD workflows using tools like **Ansible**, **Terraform**, **Shell scripting**, and **GitHub Actions**.

These projects are designed to demonstrate practical automation skills applied to production-like scenarios, with a focus on reusability, modularity, and DevOps best practices.

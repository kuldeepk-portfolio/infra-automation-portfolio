# Infrastructure Automation Portfolio

A curated portfolio of infrastructure automation projects by **Kuldeep Kumar**.

This repository showcases real-world examples of automating system configuration, cloud infrastructure provisioning, log rotation, and CI/CD workflows using tools like **Ansible**, **Terraform**, **Shell scripting**, and **GitHub Actions**.

These projects are designed to demonstrate practical automation skills applied to production-like scenarios, with a focus on reusability, modularity, and DevOps best practices.

## üöÄ Key Skills Demonstrated

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using **Terraform**
- Configuration Management with **Ansible**
- Task Scheduling & System Automation using **Shell Scripts & Cron**
- CI/CD pipelines with **GitHub Actions**
- Linux administration and cloud provisioning (AWS, Oracle Cloud)

## üìù Notes

- All projects in this portfolio are developed for **educational and demonstrative purposes** only.
- The automation scripts and infrastructure templates are designed to reflect **real-world use cases**, but they may use sample configurations, mock data, or non-production environments.
- Sensitive information such as credentials, secrets, and organization-specific data have been **intentionally excluded** or replaced with placeholders.
- You are welcome to **fork, clone, and experiment**, but please review and adapt all configurations before using them in any production setting.

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me

I'm **Kuldeep Kumar**, a Principal System Analyst with 19+ years of experience in system automation, cloud provisioning, scripting, and infrastructure engineering.

I specialize in:
- Automating infrastructure at scale using tools like **Ansible**, **Terraform**, and **Shell**
- Designing repeatable deployment pipelines and scheduled maintenance jobs
- Working across **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure**, **AWS**, and **Linux-based systems**

This repository is part of my journey to document and demonstrate my work in infrastructure automation, and to support my transition toward **cloud-native data engineering** and **DevOps-first architecture**.
